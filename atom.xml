<p>Getting back to gaming after brain surgery has been a bit weird.</p>

<p>Obviously for the first week or two I felt rubbish and had no interest in gaming at all but it wasn&rsquo;t long before I was well enough to get bored. The only problem was I couldn&rsquo;t concentrate for more than just a few minutes at a time. So I started playing text based browser games, I&rsquo;m a fan of these anyway so no great hardship there. Using the mouse and keyboard turned out to be good therapy and was helping me get my coordination back, so win win.</p>

<p>Can&rsquo;t remember which client based game I tried first, probably <a href="http://world.needforspeed.com/">Need for Speed</a>. Well that just made me feel sea sick and I haven&rsquo;t been able to play it since, a pity really because I did play it regularly. I went on to downloaded quite few others and enjoyed <a href="http://www.trionworlds.com/defiance/en/">Defiance</a> and <a href="http://www.firefallthegame.com/features">Firefall</a> (see below). I got on best with Defiance, even though it&rsquo;s a hectic game I could play at my own pace.</p>

<p>So now it&rsquo;s been five months since surgery and I&rsquo;ve just finished two months of Radiotherapy. Mainly I play browser games still (see below for details) but I&rsquo;ve just rediscovered <a href="https://warframe.com/">War Frame</a>, I played it lots last year. It&rsquo;s another hectic combat game and I can&rsquo;t play it for more than an hour or so, but it&rsquo;s changed enough over the past year to feel fresh again. So that&rsquo;s that, I&rsquo;ll be talking more about the games I come across in future posts.</p>

<h2>The Browser Games</h2>

<h4><a href="http://www.godwars.us">Godwars</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://www.godwars.us"><img class="left" src="http://socme.github.io/images/godwars.png" width="160" height="100"></a>
The fantasy universe of Godwars is an interesting and addictive dungeon crawler with bells on. A new game, not a year old yet, this one has me coming back again and again. The game is still in development, and has a lot of potential that&rsquo;s not been realized yet. Starting out is a bit confusing but once you&rsquo;ve created your prophet (main character) your quickly into the dimensions (dungeons) and ready to start bashing monsters. Plenty of help in their Wiki, but once you get started it&rsquo;s a pretty straight forward game so don&rsquo;t worry if you get stuck at first.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.sryth.com/">Sryth</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://www.sryth.com/"><img class="left" src="http://socme.github.io/images/sryth.gif" width="160" height="100"></a>
Sryth is a single-player fantasy RPG, a text based browser game. In Sryth, the game&rsquo;s events, adventures, and story-lines revolve around you the main character. You&rsquo;ll need to pay $20 for the years subscription, the game can be played for free but will soon grind to a halt without that subscription. I like the games relaxed game play and absorbing story line, it&rsquo;s turn based so smoke breaks can be taken when ever there&rsquo;s a need. With plenty to explore and lots of loot you might have to buy a house to keep it in &hellip; real money! It should keep me going for awhile, the whole year? well we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<h4><a href="http://hackandcast.com">Hack and Cast</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://hackandcast.com"><img class="left" src="http://socme.github.io/images/HaC.png" width="160" height="100"></a>
Hack and Cast hosts monthly competitions, rewarding players with cash and in-game currency. Enter into their monthly Beast Hunt competition, in which competing HAC fighters slay as many beasts as possible to win the competition.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t been playing this one long, it&rsquo;s quite slow to get started but the friendly but small user base can be generous and give you a help up. The game is in constant development and has changed quite a bit lately, for the better I would say. How long it takes before you have a chance in the competitions depends on the time you have, and the dollars you spend.</p>

<h2>The Client Games</h2>

<h4><a href="http://www.trionworlds.com/defiance/en/">Defiance</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://www.trionworlds.com/defiance/en/"><img class="left" src="http://socme.github.io/images/defiance160x100.png" width="160" height="100"></a>
A pretty hectic 3rd person shooter with lots of guns. My favorite at the moment even though my computer struggles to keep up. The pve events are much like rifts in Rift and are a lot of fun. Made in collaboration with the tv series, which I didn&rsquo;t like so much. It&rsquo;s now free to play.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.firefallthegame.com/">Firefall</a></h4>

<p><a href="http://www.firefallthegame.com/"><img class="left" src="http://socme.github.io/images/firefall160x100.png" width="160" height="100"></a>
An enjoyable game that runs well on my oldish computer. Lots of shooting with an important crafting element makes for a quite varied game. New updates have occurred since I played it last, might be worth another look. Stopped playing this in favor of Defiance, see above.</p>

<h4><a href="https://warframe.com/">War Frame</a></h4>

<p>I was lucky enough to see a Kingfisher flying up the river today, they don&rsquo;t hang about though so it was only a glimpse really. That&rsquo;s only the second I&rsquo;ve seen in the village this year, haven&rsquo;t seen one here for years.</p>

<p>Recently I purchased a new mobile phone and a 7&#8221; tablet. They&rsquo;ve both been excellent and I wouldn&rsquo;t be without them.</p>

<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/devices/#zte_openc">ZTE Open C Mobile Phone</a></p>

<p>My new phone is from ZTE but more interesting is it&rsquo;s Firefox OS which is an alternative to Android etc. It&rsquo;s web centric components should make it easier for me to write apps for, we&rsquo;ll see. This model is a nice and small 4&#8221;, liking it!
<br />
<br /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nvidia.co.uk/object/advent-vega-tegra-note-7-tablet-uk.html">Advent Vega Tegra Note 7 Tablet</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nvidia.co.uk/object/advent-vega-tegra-note-7-tablet-uk.html"><img class="left" src="http://socme.github.io/images/advent-vega-tegra-note7.png"></a></p>

<p>I needed something to take with me on my recent visit to hospital. The Tegra Note 7 was cheap in the sales and proved to be a gem. Great for games and does all those things it should plus a stylus. Good stuff.</p>

<p>This is my first tablet, and its been a lot fun finding my way around it. A friend kindly lent me their iPod for a few days. I  found its 10&#8221; screen to be to big to be comfortably mobile, also not a fan of Apples products in general. So, I find this 7&#8221; size to be much easier to handle and the more rectangular screen to be more natural to view. Thumbs up.</p>

<!--more-->


<p><br>
<br>
I still use my original model B every day as a music player, playing streams from the web. Also I use it regularly to play a couple of text based browser games that I indulge in. On the more serious side I have nodejs installed with an <a href="http://actionherojs.com/">actionhero</a> server up and running.</p>

<p>This 2.8 inch touch screen is from <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/1601">Adafruit</a>. Other manufactures and sizes are out there (<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">duck duck go</a> is your friend).</p>

<p>It looks like GitHub Pages and Octopress might be just the thing. I&rsquo;m giving it a go, so fingers crossed I&rsquo;ll be posting again.</p>

<p>Cool so far, found the install quite straight forward not for everyone though.</p>
