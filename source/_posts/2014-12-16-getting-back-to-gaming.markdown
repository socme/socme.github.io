Getting back to gaming after brain surgery has been a bit weird.

Obviously for the first week or two I felt rubbish and had no interest in gaming at all but it wasn't long before I was well enough to get bored. The only problem was I couldn't concentrate for more than just a few minutes at a time. So I started playing text based browser games, I'm a fan of these anyway so no great hardship there. Using the mouse and keyboard turned out to be good therapy and was helping me get my coordination back, so win win.

Can't remember which client based game I tried first, probably [Need for Speed](http://world.needforspeed.com/). Well that just made me feel sea sick and I haven't been able to play it since, a pity really because I did play it regularly. I downloaded quite few others and enjoyed [Defiance](http://www.trionworlds.com/defiance/en/) and [Firefall](http://www.firefallthegame.com/features) (see below). I got on best with Destiny, even though it's hectic I could play at my own pace.

So now it's been five months since the surgery and I've just finished two months of Radiotherapy. Mainly I play browser games (see below for details) but I've just rediscovered [War Frame](https://warframe.com/), I played it lots last year. It's a hectic game and I can't play it for more than an hour or so, but it's changed enough over the past year to feel fresh again. Liking it.

##The Browser Games

The fantasy universe of Godwars is an interesting and addictive dungeon crawler. A new game, not a year old yet, this one has me coming back again and again. Has a lot of potential that hasn't been realized thus far.

##The Client Games

####[Defiance](http://www.trionworlds.com/defiance/en/)
<a href="http://www.trionworlds.com/defiance/en/">{% img left /images/defiance160x100.png 160 100 %}</a>
A pretty hectic 3rd person shooter with lots of guns. My favorite at the moment even though my computer struggles to keep up. The pve events are much like rifts in Rift and are a lot of fun. Made in collaboration with the tv series, which I didn't like so much. It's now free to play.

####[Firefall](http://www.firefallthegame.com/)
<a href="http://www.firefallthegame.com/">{% img left /images/firefall160x100.png 160 100 %}</a>
An enjoyable game that runs well on my oldish computer. Lots of shooting with an important crafting element makes for a quite varied game. New updates have occurred since I played it last, might be worth another look. Stopped playing this in favor of Defiance, see above.
