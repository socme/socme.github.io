Having played it for a few weeks I can truly say this is a great game.

I was fortunate to get this game free with my new graphics card, normally it sells for around Â£50. The optimized settings for my Nvidia 960 GTX worked well, the resulting graphics quality is amazing.

The game is a single player RPG that follows an entertaining and well crafted story line, with plenty of sub-stories to explore. This post isn't intended to be a review, just my general first impressions of the game.

So, the animation is the best, loving the horse. The speech is excellent, especially in the cut scenes which are many and very well crafted. The combat system is intuitive. With only quick and heavy attacks with swords, fighting seems too simple at first but with special Witcher powers and throw-able bombs and later a crossbow combat gets as good as the rest of the game.
