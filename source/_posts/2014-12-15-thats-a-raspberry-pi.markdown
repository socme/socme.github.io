{% img left /images/Raspberry-Pi-display.jpg 160 100 %}The new [Raspberry Pi B+](http://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/) has been around for a while and now a [touch screen](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1601) is available that looks pretty neat.

I still use my original model B every day as a music player, playing streams from the web. Also I use it regularly to play a couple of text based browser games that I indulge in. On the more serious side I have nodejs installed with an [actionhero](http://actionherojs.com/) server up and running.

This 2.8 inch touch screen is from [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/1601). Other manufactures and sizes are out there ([duck duck go](https://duckduckgo.com/) is your friend).
