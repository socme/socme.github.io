Crawl - a Roguelike dungeon exploration game for Linux and Windows.
<!--more-->
[Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup](http://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/) is a fun game in the grand tradition of games like Rogue, Hack, and Moria. Your objective is to travel deep into a subterranean cave complex and retrieve the Orb of Zot, which is guarded by many horrible and hideous creatures.

I first played [Rogue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29) on a Commodore 16 in the mid 80's and loved it, in fact it wasn't long before the whole family was addicted. Over the years I've played many versions of the original, this is one of the best.
