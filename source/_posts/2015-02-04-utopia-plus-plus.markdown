Evolution: Battle for Utopia, gets a thumbs up.
<!--more-->
[Evolution: Battle for Utopia](http://evo.my.com/en/#0) from my.com is an action, RPG with strategy elements. The action sections are fast and furious battles against a variety of NPC opponents. You'll need to manage your resources wisely especially if your playing for free. Unless you spend money on this game be prepared for slow progress. There is some PVP but it's not something I'm very fond of so haven't tried it as yet.

Great graphics, fun game-play, a nice variety of side-games and cool weapons this game has a lot going for it. Been playing this free for two or three weeks now and still coming back for more, so it can't be too bad.
