Recently I purchased a new mobile phone and a 7" tablet. They've both been excellent and I wouldn't be without them.

My new phone is from ZTE but more interesting is it's Firefox OS which is an alternative to Android etc. It's web centric components should make it easier for me to write apps for, we'll see. This model is a nice and small 4", liking it!

I needed something to take with me on my recent visit to hospital. The Tegra Note 7 was cheap in the sales and proved to be a gem. Great for games and does all those things it should plus a stylus. Good stuff.

This is my first tablet, and its been a lot fun finding my way around it. A friend kindly lent me their iPod for a few days. I  found its 10" screen to be to big to be comfortably mobile, also not a fan of Apples products in general. So, I find this 7" size to be much easier to handle and the more rectangular screen to be more natural to view. Thumbs up.
