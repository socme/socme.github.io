Time to start a new project, it's a mash-up aimed directly at me.
<!--more-->
Called Wonky Cog because as the only user I shan't be to bothered if things get out of balance or ugly. Hopefully this will give me more creative freedom, a place to try out new ideas. I want somewhere I can add and remove web components, and the rest, easily. The site will be public facing but password protected.

So what framework/s to use for this single page app (SAP) that will use [Firebase](http://www.firebase.io) as a back-end. The obvious choice it seemed to me was the [Ember Framework](http://www.emberjs.com) but while looking for tutorials I did discover the [Aurelia Framework](http://www.aurelia.io). Aurelia is still in alpha, going beta in four weeks. What I like most is it's use of ES6/7 scripting via the [Babel](http://www.babeljs.io) transpiler, btw the other build tools are great too. I won't go into much detail here other than to say it's easy to get started, the code is very readable and the build system is easily understood.

In conclusion, [Aurelia](http://www.aurelia.io) (with [Bootstrap 4](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/08/19/bootstrap-4-alpha/)) is the way I will go. Wonky Cog has already been useful, it's given me the opportunity to learn ES2015 and beyond.
