Here's a few Windows programs I find indispensable.
<!--more-->
First these are my basic disc/ISO tools.


  |  |  |
  | :-------------- | :-------------- |
  | ISO2Disc | http://www.top-password.com/iso2disc.html |
  |  | This is the best burner I've found. It burns bootable ISO's to both CD/DVDs and USB flash drives (UFD). Excellent for making bootable **Windows Installation** USB drives. |
  | <br> |  |
  | WinMD5 | http://winmd5.com/ |
  |  | Nice simple MD5 calculator and checker.  No installation is required, just run the exe file. |
  | <br> |  |
  | InfraRecorder| http://infrarecorder.org/ |
  |  | A useful CD/DVD burner with some neat features ie. it can report which formats the drive can read and write. |
  | <br> |  |
  | ImageUSB | http://www.osforensics.com/tools/write-usb-images.html |
  |  | A useful tool with the ability to format or zero a USB drive or to create an ISO from a USB drive. |
  | <br> |  |
  | EasyBCD | https://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/ |
  |  | For setting up multi boot systems from Windows. Is of limited use now as Windows on a **UEFI** PC can't boot linux, see the following for an explanation (post #4). |

For the Raspberry Pi I use these:

  |  |  |
  | :-------------- | :-------------- |
  | PuTTY | http://www.putty.org/ |
  |  | PuTTY is an SSH and telnet client. Connect and control the Pi from another computer |
  | <br> |  |
  | Auremo | http://auremo.codeplex.com/ |
  |  | Auremo is a graphical client for the Music Player Daemon (MPD). Control the Pi's music player from a remote computer, makes adding streams and playlists a breeze |
