Continent of the Ninth Seal from Webzen is a very playable action rpg.

The game play is pretty hectic with lots of combo moves and big bosses. The animation is good, the graphics are OK and it runs smoothly on my oldish computer. Pleasantly surprised.

All those combos strain my memory, no bad thing really as I can use the mental exercise. Quick reactions and good timing are also important, more stuff I need to practice.
