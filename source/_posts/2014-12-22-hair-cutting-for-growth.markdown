This question has obvious relevance to me, as after 33 sessions of radiotherapy I had a goodly amount of hair loss from the top of my head. Now four weeks after the treatment I'm getting some growth and hair seems to be returning.

When the question of cutting hair to stimulate growth came up recently there was a divergence of opinion. So after a bit of web research it turns out that cutting has **NO** effect on hair growth. See below for links to more information.

This [interesting article](http://www.zapahair.com/pages/article_02.html") tells in some detail why cutting hair has no effect on hair grow.

[Shaving Myths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaving#Myths) on Wikipedia also explains how shaving may give the impression of stimulating hair growth.

An interesting [Myth Buster](http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Pages/hair-loss-myths.aspx) from the NHS.
